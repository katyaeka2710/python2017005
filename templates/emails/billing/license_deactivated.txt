Hello,

Your credit card ending in {{last_4}} was recently declined twice, leaving an outstanding balance of ${{payment.paid_amount|floatformat:2 | intcomma}} for usage of your oxd license. 

This often happens when a credit or debit card has exceeded its spending limit. Please review your payment method and contact your card issuer to find out why the charge failed. 

Your oxd license has been deactivated and all oxd installations associated with this license will not work until the balance is cleared. 

In order to complete your payment and reactivate your oxd license, please reach out to will@gluu.org.

Thank you,

Gluu
