	<p>Hello,</p>

	<p>Your credit card ending in {{last_4}} was recently declined, leaving an outstanding balance of ${{payment.paid_amount|floatformat:2 | intcomma}} for usage of your oxd license.</p>

	<p>This often happens when a credit or debit card has exceeded its spending limit. Please review your payment method and contact your card issuer to find out why the charge failed. Once you've determined the problem, update or add a new card to complete your payment and keep your oxd installations active.</p>

	<p>We will try to bill again on {{billing_date}}. If there is no valid credit card to charge your oxd license will be deactivated and all oxd installations associated with your license will stop working.</p>

	<p>If you need help completing your payment, <a href="mailto:will@gluu.org">please contact Gluu support</a>.</p>

	<p>Thank you,<br>
	Gluu</p>
